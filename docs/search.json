If anything, going through a tutorial makes it clear that you can structure and write things very differently.\nI didn’t know about the account setting for executor scope previously. It seems to have been added during an update last year. This is definitely something I will use in my config files from now on when working on clusters that use SLURM."

The almost daily bioinfo-student experience. Taking a step back, staying calm and reading the instructions/error messages/output carefully usually helps. I’d say this blog is evidence for that!"

I’m sad to have missed the class discussion, but I really enjoyed going over the course material and especially appreciated the repeated sentiment that you are a capable person who can figure things out! For me to be able to feel a sense of pride in my work I want to feel like I was the one who did it. That’s why I’ve avoided using AI when coding. I know there are valuable use cases, but I feel like that doesn’t involve the daily things but more for specific research projects with a clear idea and intention."
