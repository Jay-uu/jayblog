<h1>Plotting with ggplot2</h1>
<p>So, I have my reservations about R, mostly because of habit. While there are libraries for using ggplot2 in python - I have actually tried working with my data directly in R. It is true that ggplot is good, I just need more practice!</p>
<pre class="{R}"><code>library(ggplot2)
dat &lt;- data.frame(cond = rep(c("A", "B"), each=10),
                  xvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3),
                  yvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3))

ggplot(dat, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) + 
  geom_smooth() </code></pre>

<section id="todays-topic-ai-in-bioinformatics" class="level1">
<h1>Today’s topic: AI in Bioinformatics</h1>
<p>Because of some network issues, this course section was moved to a day when I worked from home. I’m sad to have missed the class discussion, but I really enjoyed going over the course material and especially appreciated the repeated sentiment that you are a capable person who can figure things out! For me to be able to feel a sense of pride in my work I want to feel like I was the one who did it. That’s why I’ve avoided using AI when coding. I know there are valuable use cases, but I feel like that doesn’t involve the daily things but more for specific research projects with a clear idea and intention.</p>

<section id="todays-topics-nextflow" class="level1">
<h1>Today’s topics: Nextflow</h1>
<p>After developing a nextflow pipeline for 2 years, I feel like I’m intimately familiar with the language, but there’s always new things to learn! If anything, going through a tutorial makes it clear that you can structure and write things very differently.</p>
<p>I didn’t know about the account setting for <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html#executor">executor</a> scope previously. It seems to have been added during an update last year. This is definitely something I will use in my config files from now on when working on clusters that use SLURM.</p>

<h1>Today’s topics: Pixi and Containers</h1>
<p><a href="&quot;lilac_liverpool_flowers.JPG&quot;" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="jay-uu.github.io/jayblog/posts/image-posts/&quot;lilac_liverpool_flowers.JPG&quot;" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<section id="environments" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="environments">Environments</h2>
<p>Pixi seems like a really nice environment manager. I especially like that you can run things from outside the env. There’s benefits to having the environment with the project, both for easier cleanup but also to easily have scripts associated with an environment. I like that conda keeps all the environments in one place, it feels clean, but this way also makes a lot of sense.</p>
</section>
<section id="containers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="containers">Containers</h2>
<p>Containers are something I’ve really wanted to try out for a long time. I think it’s something that would be so good to have when I finally get around to publishing my work. Making my own container image will probably be a challenge, but at least now I have some familiarity with using them - and that’s the first step!</p>

<h1>Today’s topics: Git and Quarto</h1>
<p><a href="fire_1.JPG" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="jay-uu.github.io/jayblog/posts/image-posts/fire_1.JPG" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<section id="git" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Samuel taught us how to cooperate on a git project. I’ve worked a lot with git alone, keeping track of the development of my <a href="https://github.com/Jay-uu/pangenome-pipeline">Nextflow pipeline</a>. Working together with others in parallel was new, and a good exercise to get more familiar with the local repo, the staging area, the branches and the remote repo.</p>
</section>
<section id="quarto" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quarto">Quarto</h2>
<p>Following a tutorial step-by-step sounds easy, but suddenly you miss a step (somehow) and you have to back track and do things over and over to try and solve whatever issue you caused by not being familiar enough with the tool/method/commands yet. The almost daily bioinfo-student experience. Taking a step back, staying calm and reading the instructions/error messages/output carefully usually helps. I’d say this blog is evidence for that!</p>

<p>While this text is only visible when you’re on the page for this post.<br> This is a picture I took while out on a walk during spring last year. Maybe it doesn’t have anything directly to do with bioinformatics, but if you think about it - don’t you wonder what’s living in there?</p>
