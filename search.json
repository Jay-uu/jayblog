This is a picture I took while out on a walk during spring last year. Maybe it doesn’t have anything directly to do with bioinformatics, but if you think about it - don’t you wonder what’s living in there?"

Working together with others in parallel was new, and a good exercise to get more familiar with the local repo, the staging area, the branches and the remote repo.\n\n\n\nFollowing a tutorial step-by-step sounds easy, but suddenly you miss a step (somehow) and you have to back track and do things over and over to try and solve whatever issue you caused by not being familiar enough with the tool/method/commands yet. The almost daily bioinfo-student experience. Taking a step back, staying calm and reading the instructions/error messages/output carefully usually helps. I’d say this blog is evidence for that!"

I like that conda keeps all the environments in one place, it feels clean, but this way also makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n\nContainers are something I’ve really wanted to try out for a long time. I think it’s something that would be so good to have when I finally get around to publishing my work.
