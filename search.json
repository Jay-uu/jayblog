I like that conda keeps all the environments in one place, it feels clean, but this way also makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n\nContainers are something I’ve really wanted to try out for a long time. I think it’s something that would be so good to have when I finally get around to publishing my work. Making my own container image will probably be a challenge, but at least now I have some familiarity with using them - and that’s the first step!"

If anything, going through a tutorial makes it clear that you can structure and write things very differently.\nI didn’t know about the account setting for executor scope previously. It seems to have been added during an update last year. This is definitely something I will use in my config files from now on when working on clusters that use SLURM."
