Maybe it doesn’t have anything directly to do with bioinformatics, but if you think about it - don’t you wonder what’s living in there?"

The almost daily bioinfo-student experience. Taking a step back, staying calm and reading the instructions/error messages/output carefully usually helps. I’d say this blog is evidence for that!"
