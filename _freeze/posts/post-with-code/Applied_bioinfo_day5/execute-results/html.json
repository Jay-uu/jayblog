While there are libraries for using ggplot2 in python - I have actually tried working with my data directly in R. It is true that ggplot is good, I just need more practice!\n\n```{R}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndat <- data.frame(cond = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each=10),\n                  xvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3),\n                  yvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3))\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) +\n  geom_point(shape=1) + \n  geom_smooth() \n```\n\n",
