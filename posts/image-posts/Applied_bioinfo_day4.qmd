# Today's topic: AI in Bioinformatics

Because of some network issues, this course section was moved to a day when I worked from home. I'm sad to have missed the class discussion, but I really enjoyed going over the course material and especially appreciated the repeated sentiment that you are a capable person who can figure things out! For me to be able to feel a sense of pride in my work I want to feel like I was the one who did it. That's why I've avoided using AI when coding.
I know there are valuable use cases, but I feel like that doesn't involve the daily things but more for specific research projects with a clear idea and intention.
