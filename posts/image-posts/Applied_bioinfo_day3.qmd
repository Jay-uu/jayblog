# Today's topics: Nextflow

After developing a nextflow pipeline for 2 years, I feel like I'm intimately familiar with the language, but there's always new things to learn! If anything, going through a tutorial makes it clear that you can structure and write things very differently.


I didn't know about the account setting for [executor](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html#executor) scope previously. It seems to have been added during an update last year. This is definitely something I will use in my config files from now on when working on clusters that use SLURM.
