# Plotting with ggplot2

So, I have my reservations about R, mostly because of habit. While there are libraries for using ggplot2 in python - I have actually tried working with my data directly in R. It is true that ggplot is good, I just need more practice!

library(ggplot2)
dat <- data.frame(cond = rep(c("A", "B"), each=10),
                  xvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3),
                  yvar = 1:20 + rnorm(20,sd=3))

ggplot(dat, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) + 
  geom_smooth()
